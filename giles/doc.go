// Package giles implements an archiver that follows the sMAP protocol
//
// Overview
//
// Part of the motivation for the creation of Giles was to emphasize the
// distinction between sMAP the software (originally written in Python) and
// sMAP the profile. The Giles archiver is an implementation of the latter,
// and is intended to be fully compatible with existing sMAP tools.
//
// One of the "innovations" that Giles brings to the sMAP ecosystem is the
// notion that what is typically thought of as the sMAP "archiver" is really
// a collection of components: the message bus/frontend, the timeseries store,
// the metadata store, and the query language. All of these are closely linked,
// of course, but treating them as separate entities means that we can use
// different timeseries or metadata databases or even different implementations
// of the query language (perhaps over Apache Spark/Mlib?)
